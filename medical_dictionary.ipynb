The IEM is a 1 mm\\n    sized sensor embedded in the ABILIFY MYCITE tablet. Upon contact with gastric fluid, magnesium\\n    and cuprous chloride within the IEM react to activate and power the device. The IEM then\\n    communicates to the MYCITE Patch, to track aripiprazole ingestion.\\n    A MYCITE Patch (wearable sensor) is designed to detect the ingestion of the ABILIFY MYCITE\\n    tablet, record the ingestion of the IEM, and transmit ingestion data to the mobile patient application\\n    (app).\\n    A compatible mobile patient application (app) displays this data to allow patients to review their\\n    medication ingestion. These data can be shared with healthcare providers and caregivers.\\n    Web-based portal or dashboard for health care professionals (HCP) and caregivers.\\n    \"}"
